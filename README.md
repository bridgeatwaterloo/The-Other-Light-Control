# The-Other-Light Control

The Other Interactive Lights: Processing code

## Instructions

Clone this repository using GitHub desktop, and make sure it is saved into your Arduino folder.

Create a new branch off the master branch called 'your-first-name/blink-fade-sketches' (a useful format for branch names on a collaborative project is 'developer-name/new-feature-description').

> "it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix"
[The Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

Anything in the master branch should be ready to go live, so never commit directly into master.

Work in this new branch, and make sure you only commit into this new branch.

When you are happy with your work, or when you want to save it to the remote server, commit it into your branch using GitHub desktop, and sync.

Create a Pull Request from your branch into 'master'. If you ever want feedback on your progress from someone on the team, send them a link to your Pull Request, and discuss things in there.

When you are confident your code is ready to go into production, share the URL of your Pull Request with the team on the [Pull Requests](https://digital-futures-team.slack.com/messages/pull-requests/) channel in Slack.
